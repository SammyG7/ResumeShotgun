This document outlines the group's meeting notes for every group meeting. 

\section{Considerations} \label{sec:considerations}
A formal "meeting" must be conducted over a call, meaning any messaging through text will not be included in this document. Meetings in which there were no major decisions will not be thoroughly documented. Cancelled meetings will still be noted in \nameref{sec:history}, but potential meetings that did not occur will not. Times will not be indicated and will be assumed to follow the \nameref{sec:plan} unless there are two meetings in a day or it is a meeting at a time not originally considered.

\section{Meeting Plan} \label{sec:plam}
Unless otherwise mentioned, our group will meet during the alotted lab sessions in person (Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30am-11:20am). If the group requires additional meetings, they will likely be conducted either Thursday from 5:00pm up until 10:00pm, or Friday from 4:30pm up until 11:00pm, as these are the only times outside of lab sessions all members should be consistently available. The designated scribe (alternates between members) will only need to actively take notes during major meetings.
