This document outlines the group's meeting notes for every group meeting. 

\section{Considerations} \label{sec:considerations}

A formal "meeting" must be conducted over a call, meaning any messaging through text will not be included in this document. Meetings in which there were no major decisions will not be thoroughly documented. Cancelled meetings will still be noted in \nameref{sec:history}, but potential meetings that did not occur will not.

\section{Meeting Plan}

Unless otherwise mentioned, our group will meet during the alotted lab sessions in person (Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30am-11:20am). If the group requires additional meetings, they will likely be conducted either Thursday from 5:00pm up until 10:00pm, or Friday from 4:30pm up until 11:00pm, as these are the only times outside of lab sessions all members should be consistently available. The designated scribe (alternates between members) will only need to actively take notes during major meetings.

\subsection{Thursday February 17, In-Lab}

\textbf{Meeting cancelled}. All members had completed all lab tasks for the week already and therefore did not need to go in person. All members also had a midterm for another class later that day.
