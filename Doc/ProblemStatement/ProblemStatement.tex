\section*{What Problem Are You Trying To Solve?}
\section*{Why Is This An Important Problem?}
In our modern world, online job searching is becoming increasingly prevalent. 
Most students searching for Co-Op positions and adults entering the workforce have to work full time 
just to sift through hundreds of job postings searching for relevant applications. This work is tedious 
and unnecessary. The time that this process takes is time that many people simply don’t have.
The current tool partially alleviates this problem but still lacks a lot of functionality. 

It’s scope is currently limited in which sites it functions on, and it doesn’t provide much 
customizability for the user. Allowing the user to add more meaningful filters to their search, 
along with bringing the tool to more relevant sites that the original developer missed will 
greatly increase the power of the program while keeping the core concept behind it the same.
